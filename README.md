# Project 1 â€“ Lexical Analyzer

This project builds a lexical analyzer that scans source code and breaks it into tokens.  
It detects valid tokens like identifiers, keywords, numbers, and symbols, while also reporting any lexical errors.  
The output lists tokens in the order they appear in the source file.
